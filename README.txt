Godot Blastoff is a lightweight Godot project template that has menus, options, music and saving already set up so you can jump right into making the game!

My goal is to provide a simple yet feature rich template which is easy to customize and expand on.

Things that are different from a Godot new project:

    Preset Scenes
        Intro
        Main Menu
        Options Menu
        Credits
        Empty Level
    Autoloads
        Global Variables
        Saving System
        Music Player
        Pause Menu
        Scene Fader

All with full basic functionality

The preset has a couple of modified options that you may want to change based on the project you are working on.

    Window
        Resolution and Test Resolution set to 640x360
        Stretch set to Viewport keep Aspect
    Rendering - 2D
        Enabled GPU Pixel Snap
    Debug
        Force FPS set to 60
    Audio
        Added Audio Busses for Effects and Music

This template is completely free to use and modify for every project without contribution.

If you have any questions, requests or feedback i would like to hear about it!
